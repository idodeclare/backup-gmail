  * Since users can hide special folders in IMAP, treat them as
    optional to avoid KeyError
    
backup-gmail 0.2
  * Full and incremental backup are now the same operation, and re-running
	any backup will only write newly-detected messages ('label' is still
	always written fully after each backup). backup-gmail no longer deletes
	any data
  * add KeyringUtil to use keyring library (if available at runtime)
	for secure handling of saved passwords instead of writing plaintext
	to .cfg files. Existing password settings in .cfg files will be used 
	but will not be automatically written anymore.
	(See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring for installation help)
  * Use Gmail's XLIST command to map special internationalized folders
  * --mbox_export is now a separate, optional operation, which can be done
	on its own or after a backup
  * backup_gmail.Gmail objects support a graceful cancel() method intended
	to be called from a separate thread (as in gui.py). (Interrupting 
	the command-line backup_gmail.py still terminates immediately).
  * gui.py operates directly on backup_gmail.Gmail objects instead of 
	running the backup_gmail "do" methods, and it connects the 
	QProgressDialog cancel to Gmail.cancel()
  * use en_US date formatting in Gmail.searchByDate
  * improved completion messages for restore or save to reflect the count
	of messages handled from the total set
  * progress can use a custom formatter for values, as with backup to
	format values as '%.2f MB'
  * Messages without MESSAGE-ID still get a hash@backup-gmail.com id in 
	label, but the RFC content is no longer touched
  * Handle invalid dates in messages when filtering by date. Such messages
	will not be matched
  * --strict_exclude indicates that messages are to be skipped by
	MESSAGE-ID in addition to folder
  * add --prompt mode to pass credentials as STDIN instead of the command-line
  * fix: --end_date behavior is date exclusive, so update usage, and 
	gui.py now passes date+1
  * fix gui.py bug where include_labels or exclude_labels were not properly
	unset between runs if the mode changed
