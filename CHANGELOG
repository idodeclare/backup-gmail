backup-gmail 0.2
  * Display more informative progress and completion messages
  * Use Gmail's XLIST command to map special folders
  * Full and incremental backup are now the same operation, and re-running
    any backup will only write new messages ('label' is still always 
    written fully after each backup). backup-gmail no longer deletes
    any data
  * --mbox_export is now a separate optional operation, which can be done 
    on its own or after a backup
  * Messages without MESSAGE-ID still get a hash@backup-gmail.com id, but
    the RFC content is no longer touched
  * Handle invalid dates in messages when filtering by date. Such messages
    will not be matched
  * Do not pass mkdir OSError. Instead use isdir to determine whether to mk
  * --strict_exclude indicates that messages are to be skipped by 
    MESSAGE-ID in addition to folder
  * add --prompt mode to pass credentials as STDIN instead of the 
    command-line
  * do not save passwords in plaintext .cfg files. (Investigating using 
    Keyring lib for secure storage)
  * --end_date is BEFORE (exclusive). Update usage. gui.py now passes date+1
