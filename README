== Usage ==
./backup_gmail.py
or
./gui.py


== Caveats ==

Time Zones:
  A backup operation processes --start and --end using Gmail's servers,
and time zones are respected; dates will be qualified using the user's
configured Gmail time zone.
  --mbox_export and --restore, however, do not currently respect time 
zones for --start and --end, so results can be slightly incorrect near
the date range boundaries.

== Additional Libraries ==
